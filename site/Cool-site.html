    <h3>What is Diwali?</h3>
    <p>Diwali is a festival of lights mainly celebrated by Hindus. The festival usually lasts five days and celebrated during the Hindu Lunisolar month Kartika (between mid-October and mid-November).One of the most popular festivals of Hinduism, Diwali symbolizes the spiritual "victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance".The festival is widely associated with Lakshmi, goddess of prosperity, with many other regional traditions connecting the holiday to Sita and Rama, Vishnu, Krishna, Yama, Yami, Durga, Kali, Hanuman, Ganesha, Kubera, Dhanvantari, or Vishvakarman. Furthermore, it is, in some regions, a celebration of the day Lord Rama returned to his kingdom Ayodhya with his wife Sita and his brother Lakshmana after defeating Ravana in Lanka and serving 14 years of exile.

In the lead-up to Diwali, celebrants will prepare by cleaning, renovating, and decorating their homes and workplaces with diyas (oil lamps) and rangolis.[14] During Diwali, people wear their finest clothes, illuminate the interior and exterior of their homes with diyas and rangoli, perform (Lakshmi puja) – worship ceremonies of Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity and wealth,light fireworks, and partake in family feasts, where mithai (sweets) and gifts are shared. Diwali is also a major cultural event for the Hindu and Jain diaspora from the Indian subcontinent.

The five-day long festival originated in the Indian subcontinent and is mentioned in early Sanskrit texts. Diwali is usually celebrated twenty days after the Dashera (Dasara, Dasain) festival, with Dhanteras, or the regional equivalent, marking the first day of the festival when celebrants prepare by cleaning their homes and making decorations on the floor, such as rangolis. The second day is Naraka Chaturdashi. The third day is the day of Lakshmi Puja and the darkest night of the traditional month. In some parts of India, the day after Lakshmi Puja is marked with the Govardhan Puja and Balipratipada (Padwa). Some Hindu communities mark the last day as Bhai Dooj or the regional equivalent, which is dedicated to the bond between sister and brother,while other Hindu and Sikh craftsmen communities mark this day as Vishwakarma Puja and observe it by performing maintenance in their work spaces and offering prayers.

Some other faiths in India also celebrate their respective festivals alongside Diwali. The Jains observe their own Diwali which marks the final liberation of Mahavira, the Sikhs celebrate Bandi Chhor Divas to mark the release of Guru Hargobind from a Mughal Empire prison, while Newar Buddhists, unlike other Buddhists, celebrate Diwali by worshipping Lakshmi, while the Hindus of Eastern India and Bangladesh generally celebrate Diwali, by worshipping Goddess Kali. The main day of the festival of Diwali (the day of Lakshmi puja) is an official holiday in Fiji, Guyana, India, Malaysia (except Sarawak), Mauritius, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago.</p>

    <h3>Why is Diwali Celebrated?</h3>
    <p>North India celebrates Diwali as the return of Lord Rama to Ayodhya. After 14 years of exile, Rama along his wife Sita and brother Laxman returned home.Since it was a new moon day and was dark, his subjects lit diyas across the kingdom that day.This tradition is still followed to this day.
In South India, celebration of Diwali varies even among the states. Kerala generally does not celebrate Diwali. Many speculate that this may be because King Bali a virtuous demon king was killed this day. The other three states celebrates the occasion in honor of Lord Krishna's consort Satyabhama killing the demon king — Narakasura and freeing thousands of girls in his captivity. It is celebrated a day before Diwali, and the occasion is called Naraka Chaturdashi.
In West India, Diwali is considered as the start of a new year and is predominantly about worshipping the goddess of wealth, Lakshmi. It’s the festival of light and wealth, especially in Gujarat</p>

    <h3>Ill effects of Fire Crackers</h3>
    <p>The 51% of which is caused by the industrial pollution, 27% by vehicles, 8% by crop burning and 5% by diwali fireworks. The tradition of annual Diwali fireworks has caused widespread coverage in Indian media, where debate has centred on air quality within Indian cities in autumn and winter and the role the fireworks play. On 9 October 2017, the Supreme Court of India banned the sale, but not use, of fireworks in Delhi during the Diwali season,[180] with the assumption that banning the use of fireworks would substantially improve the air quality of Delhi. Critics stated that the ruling was judicial over-reach and a bias against Hindu culture, while supporters stated that it would be beneficial to public health.

Scholars have stated that many factors contribute to the poor air quality in Delhi, and northern India, that accompanies the harvest festival of Diwali. According to Jethva and others, the post-monsoon custom is to prepare the crop fields by deliberately burning the residual stubble between October and November. As crop productivity per hectare has increased with mechanised harvesting, this has led to the practice becoming more widespread in the northern and northwestern regions of India in the months when Diwali is observed. The smoke from the burning of the fields is carried by seasonal winds over the floodplain, where it is inverted by the colder winds and spread throughout the region for much of the winter. Other contributors to the poor air quality include daily vehicular and industrial activity along with the burning of other biomass.

A study of residential areas of Delhi in 2006–08, found that concentration of particulate matter as well as sulphur dioxide increased on the day of Diwali relative to other days of the month and that the increase could be exacerbated by prevailing meteorological conditions; there was also a correlated increase in ambient noise levels. Another study of air pollution in Delhi found that the PM2.5 levels in 2015 and 2016 did rise over Diwali, but these higher levels were "a result of contribution from fireworks on the Diwali night, trans-regional movement of pollutants due to crop residue burning, low wind speed, and high humidity". The authors concluded that the contribution of the festival fireworks could lead to a 1.3% increase in the non-carcinogenic hazard index.[184] Other studies have stated that the fireworks of Diwali produce particulates and pollutants with a decay-life time of about one day.</p>

    <h3>Effect of cracker ban on livlihoods of cracker industry workers </h3>
    <p>Hundreds of families in Virudhunagar are shocked and upset over the announcements made by multiple State governments banning the sale and usage of firecrackers this Deepavali season.

Already reeling under the impact of the pandemic and associated lockdowns, these families are now staring at abject poverty, if the sale of crackers is not up to the mark. So far, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Odisha, and Haryana have announced a ban.

“The firecracker industry is a fragile ecosystem. A damage caused to any one part of it can have debilitating impact on a large number of families across the nation,” says Elangovan of fireworks traders association.       

The biggest damage, he adds, will be in Sivakasi. Industry experts say that over 80 per cent of cracker sales happen on the day before the festival. “While products have been shipped away to different States, we are yet to receive payments from many traders,” claims Elangovan.  

Wholesale buyers in North India, their dealers, and local shopkeepers are all likely to be hit hard this year. Elangovan says, in Sivakasi, the business is done on a credit-based system. “We receive payments after the festival, which is used to pay off bonus for workers, loans, and to invest in the business for the year ahead.” Around 2 lakh persons are directly employed in the firecracker sector of Sivakasi, and Rajasthan is one of their major market – contributing almost 12 per cent to overall sales every year.

“We have followed every rule in the book in making ‘green fireworks’ this year,” says Ganesan Panjurajan of another fireworks manufacturers association. “If more States follow suit, this Deepavali will be a dark one for us.”</p>
